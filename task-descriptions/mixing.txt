Mixing is a process manufacturing capability that has three liquids as inputs and creates a liquid mixture as an output. In addition to the actual input products, there are four input information. The first one is the total volume to be mixed. And the other three are the volume fractions of each liquid. In this case, the volume fraction is defined as the volume of one liquid divided by the total volume of all three oinput liquids in the mixture.
The volume fraction of each liquid can be parameterized, but there are restrictions to each volume fraction. The volume fraction of liquid 1 must be <= 0.5. The volume fraction of liquid 2 must be between 0.2 and 0.5 and the volume fraction of liquid 3 must be <= 0.1. The total volume can also be parameterized, but is required to be <= 10.
Mixing is restricted by one capability constraint: The sum of the three input volume fractions must be equal to 1, so that the composition of the mixture is fully defined.
