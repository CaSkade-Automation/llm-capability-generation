There is a addition capability that receives two numbers "a" and "b" as input and returns sum "c" as output, where all three entities are information. Each of the two inputs has a property that determines the value of type integer for this number, which is only determined when the capability is used. In the same way, the output sum has a property that gives the result of type integer of the addition as an assurance.
