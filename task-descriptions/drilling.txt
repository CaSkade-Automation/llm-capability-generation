"Drilling" is supposed to be a capability description for a simple drilling process in manufacturing. It transforms a blank product (before drilling) into a drilled product. The blank product is an input, the drilled product an output. In addition, drilling has two additional inputs, which are both information: The diameter and depth of the hole to be drilled. Both these information have corresponding properties that can be freely selected. In addition, there is a requirement for each of the two properties: The depth must be less than 80 mm. And the diameter must be between 1mm and 20 mm.
The output product has two properties, which are assurances of the diameter and depth given as input. This is controlled by two capability constraints. One states that the property of the input information "diameter" is equal to the output product's diameter. 
The second capability constraint states that the property of the input information "depth" is equal to the output product's depth.
