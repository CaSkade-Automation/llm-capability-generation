There is a transport capability provided by an agv, which is a resource. The agv has a property that determines the position of the agv as an actual value. The property is of type position type, which specifies the position in coordinates consisting of longitude and latitude measured in decimal degrees. The capability receives a product to be transported and a destination, which is an information, to where the product has to be transported as input. The capability returns the product at the destination as output. Each of these three entities has a property that determines the position of type position type. The position of the input information destination is only determined when the capability is used. The position of the input product is an actual value. For the agv to be able to transport the product, the position of the product has to be equal to the position of the agv. In the same way, the output product has a property that gives the position as an assurance, which has to be equal to to the desired destination from the input.
