There is a transport capability provided by an agv, which is a resource. The agv has a property that determines the position of the agv as an actual value. The property is of type position, which specifies the position in coordinates consisting of longitude and latitude measured in decimal degrees. The capability takes as input a product "a" to be transported and a information "goal" about where the product needs to be transported. The capability returns a product "a_goal" at the destination as output. Each of these three entities has a property that determines the position. The position of the information "goal" is freely selectable. The position of the input "a" is an actual value. For the agv to be able to transport "a", the position of "a" must be equal to the position of the agv. Likewise, the output "a_goal" has a property that gives the position as an assurance, which must be equal to the desired information from the input "goal".
