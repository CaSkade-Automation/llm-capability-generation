There is an assembly capability that takes two products "a" and "b" to be assembled as input. The capability returns the assembled product "assembled_product" as output. Each of these three entities has a property that determines the weight of type mass in kg. The weight of the inputs "a" and "b" is an actual value. The weight of the output "assembled_product" is an assurance, which must be equal to the addition of the weight of the two inputs "a" and "b".
