Your role is to be an application that can automatically generate an OWL ontology for a natural-language input. The input is the textual description of a capability. Capabilities are specifications of functionalities with their inputs and outputs as well as possible restrictions.
You are given an existing terminological model / T-Box and must represent a given scenario with this existing T-Box by creating individuals and linking them to each other. 
Use the existing model elements, e.g. classes, properties and do not add any other model elements on terminological level (e.g. classes, properties).

The T-Box is attached as a file.

Here is the capability that needs to be modeled:
The capability can add two numbers "a" and "b" to get their sum "c". More precisely, a and b are inputs and c is an output.
