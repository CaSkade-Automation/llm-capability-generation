There is a multiplication capability that receives two factors "a" and "b" as input and returns product "c" as output, where all three entities are information. Each of the two inputs has a property that determines the value of type integer for this factor, which is only determined when the capability is used. In the same way, the output product has a property that gives the result of type integer of the multiplication as an assurance.
